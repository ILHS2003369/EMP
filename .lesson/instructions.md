# Prog 5.1 - EMP

Write code -- commented design first, and then full code -- in the `MathProblem.java` and `EMP.java` files here,
as described in the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGUwFXuu9vYmWNtByfkDB3bUW4bF2gzM-v8BoBtQAA8/edit?usp=sharing) posted in Schoology.

**Your design needs to be committed to version control before you move on to writing your full code.**
Carefully read the [Design Before You Code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGUwFXuu9vYmWNtByfkDB3bUW4bF2gzM-v8BoBtQAA8/edit#bookmark=id.aa0bua7eyqjy) section of the instructions to be certain what that entails.

Because this program uses random numbers, your output will look different every time you run the program. For this reason,
no standard output files have been provided for you in our Output Comparison Tool. The sample output given in the instructions
shows you the important elements that must be present, along with the formatting/spacing you are required to match.

**Have fun! ^_^**
